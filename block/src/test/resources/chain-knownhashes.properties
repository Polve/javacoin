# Contains known hashes of some networks
# Syntax: chain.<id>.<depth> = <hash>
#    Where <id> is the chain identifier in this config file
#          <depth> is the index of the block with 0 as the genesis block
#          <hash> is the hash number the block should have
# The entry chain.<id>.0=<hash> is a special one, for the genesis
# block. This is not validated, rather this is used to select the proper
# chain to validate the rest of the entries.

# This is a known hashes list for unit tests
